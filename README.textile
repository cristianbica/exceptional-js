Our technique only works in browsers that support the window.onerror event, such as Internet Explorer (6,7,8,9) and Firefox (all versions). We can’t track errors in Webkit based browsers (e.g. Chrome, Safari) as they don’t yet support the window.onerror event. There is a "bug filed about this at webkit.org":https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8519.
